AI Growth
This project is creating a deep learning program that is influenced by emotions, context tracking, subject monitoring and playfulness.
The program starts with a basic understanding and gets the user to teach it more. 
If the user speaks too compilcatedly, the program gets frustrated and lets the user know. The user is forced to reword the response until the program understands. After understanding, the program builds on this and becomes less frustrated and eventualy learns more and more.
Ultimately, the program seeks new information by asking the user directly to teach it about something not mentioned before.


Join us in creating a unique AI program.
